0. Preface
The power of Open-Source is the power of the people. It's by far the strongest asset of the tech industry. In fact, I'm not aware of any other fields of work where sharing information and work openly is as highly prioritized and encouraged as it is in the tech world.
And not only that, it's also highly beneficial for the individual contributor. The takeaways from becoming an active contributor to Open-Source are huge - and potentially life-changing. In this book, I will highlight some of the many benefits of contributing to and running - Open Source Projects. When you are finished reading, you will have a clear understanding of what Open-Source is and why it's important. It will be especially clear how you can use Open-Source ot build a strong reputation, boost your career and help your business generate more revenue.
I will be sharing a nnumber of examples and case studies from some of the most prominent Open-Source contributors in the tech space. Additionally, I will provide with templates, Readme and other examples that you can appy direclty to your own Open-Source project.
